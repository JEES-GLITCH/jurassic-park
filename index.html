      Jurassic Park is a 1993 American science fiction action film[4] directed
      by Steven Spielberg, produced by Kathleen Kennedy and Gerald R. Molen, and
      starring Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Richard Attenborough.
      It is the first installment in the Jurassic Park franchise, and the first
      film in the original Jurassic Park trilogy, and is based on Michael
      Crichton's 1990 novel of the same name, with a screenplay by Crichton and
      David Koepp. The film is set on the fictional island of Isla Nublar, off
      Central America's Pacific Coast near Costa Rica, where a wealthy
      businessman John Hammond (Attenborough), and a team of genetic scientists
      have created a wildlife park of de-extinct dinosaurs. When industrial
      sabotage leads to a catastrophic shutdown of the park's power facilities
      and security precautions, a small group of visitors, including Hammond's
      grandchildren, struggle to survive and escape the now perilous island.

          Industrialist John Hammond has created Jurassic Park, a theme park of
          cloned dinosaurs, on the tropical island Isla Nublar, located off of
          the coast of Costa Rica. After a Velociraptor kills a dinosaur
          handler, the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro,
          demand a safety certification. Gennaro invites chaotician Ian Malcolm,
          and Hammond invites paleontologist Alan Grant and paleobotanist Ellie
          Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is shocked to see a live
          Brachiosaurus and other dinosaurs. At the park's visitor center, the
          group learns that the cloning was accomplished by extracting dinosaur
          DNA from prehistoric mosquitoes preserved in amber. DNA from frogs,
          among other animals, was used to fill in gaps in the dinosaurs'
          genome. To prevent breeding, the dinosaurs were made female by direct
          chromosome manipulation. The group witnesses the hatching of a baby
          Velociraptor and visits the raptor enclosure. During lunch, the group
          debates the ethics of cloning and the park's creation. Malcolm warns
          of the implications of genetic engineering and scoffs at the park's
          design, saying it will inevitably break down.
